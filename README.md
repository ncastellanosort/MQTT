<h1>MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)</h1>

<h3>https://www.hivemq.com/demos/websocket-client/</h3>

<h5>Is a lightweight and efficient communication protocol designed for data transmission in networks with limited bandwidth and resource-constrained devices, such as sensors, IoT devices, and automation systems. It utilizes a publish/subscribe model, allowing devices to publish messages to specific topics, which are then subscribed to by other devices, offering flexibility and scalability in communication. MQTT supports different levels of Quality of Service (QoS) for message delivery reliability and includes features such as message retention, last will and testament, and robust security mechanisms, including authentication, authorization, and data encryption. It finds widespread use in IoT, industrial automation, telemetry, remote monitoring, and other scenarios where efficient and dependable communication is essential across low-speed or unstable networks.</h5>
